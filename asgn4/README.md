# A Multi-Threaded HTTP Server
This is an implementation of a multithread web server written in c. A lot of sample code for the server functionality was provided through a resources module.

Usage:
```
./httpserver [-t thread_count] <port>
```

Then users can perform get and put requests asynchronously using curl or a web browser.
